This pages contains instructions on how to deploy an already built service onto the Service Virtualization Platform for Service Oriented integration. 

==Deploy Steps==

  # Download jar/zip file/s containing services from [http://code.google.com/p/skltpservices/downloads/list downloads]
  # If download is a zip, unzip all the containing jars
  # Copy jar files to *`/<vp_home>/vp/services/`* directory
  # Restart server
  # Verify no error occurred during startup in logs, `/<mule_home>/logs/vp.log`

In case the service platform does not start because of the new services deployed
  * Capture the errorlog to use when reporting the error
  * Remove the newly deployed service
  * Restart server
