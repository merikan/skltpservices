Q: How do i perform a release of a complete domain, e-g crm:scheduling <br>
A: All interactions are wrapped with maven support and a release is done using the following steps
  # Create a release, step up SNAPSHOT version: 
{{{
<domain>/trunk/$ mvn release:prepare
}}}
  # We do not perform the actual release. When done with step 1 just clean up using:
{{{
<domain>/trunk/$ mvn release:clean
}}}
